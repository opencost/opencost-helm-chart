## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add opencost https://opencost.github.io/opencost-helm-chart
```

You can then run `helm search repo opencost` to see the charts.
